- Greetings, Iâ€™m @Buruno29.
- Interested in Programing logics overall.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Python, trying to find myself anywhere in the gap of front-end/back-end, 
attempting to reach certifications, and review other languages.
-I have learned C, C++, I have knowledge on Java but faint and basic knowledge on Python.
- Uncertain on what I would wish to colaborate, I have knowledge here and there but not really advanced.
