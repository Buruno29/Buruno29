- Greetings, Iâ€™m @Buruno29.
- Interested in Programing logics overall.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Python, trying to find myself anywhere in the gap of front-end/back-end, 
attempting to reach certifications, and review other languages.
- I have learned things about Theory of computation, Computer Architecture, Software Enginering, Object Oriented Programming, C++, a little of Java, somewhat of JS and a lot of Python.
- Uncertain on what I would wish to colaborate, I have knowledge here and there but nothing really elaborate.
-Currently learning React and React Native, JS for the sake of a project.
- I Would love to find a job in which I could relearn properly and have any usage for the skills of which I have barely practiced.
