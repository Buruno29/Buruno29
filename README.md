- Greetings, I’m @Buruno29.
- Interested in Programing logics overall.
- I’m currently learning Python, trying to find myself anywhere in the gap of front-end/back-end, 
attempting to reach certifications, and review other languages.
-I have learned things about Theory of computation, Computer Architecture, Software Enginering, Object Oriented Programming,
C, C++, Java but faint and basic Python.
- Uncertain on what I would wish to colaborate, I have knowledge here and there but not really advanced.
- I Would love to find a job in which I could relearn properly and have any usage for the skills of which
I have barely practiced.
- 📫 How to reach me: brunoma2912@gmail.com ...
